Multi-Channel Instrumental Veto

A suite of tools that correlates detector transients with auxiliary channels.


Primary scripts:

glitch_map - calculate 2-D glitch correlation for a pair of instrument channels

deriv_map - calculate 2-D glitch correlation for a channel and its derivative

mask_gen - generate a veto mask from glitch maps

veto_gen - calculate veto segments using a veto mask

seg_study - generate veto statistics 

mciv_web_gen - web page output




Support scripts:

MCIV_start - initializes the mapping routines

MCIV_tools - library of functions for grabbing data, filtering, segment handing and veto safety checks

MCIV_condor - wrapper for MCIV_start that prepares multiple channel pairs for parallel processing

plot_tools - extra plotting for glitch_map output

test_segments - compares MCIV veto segments against veto definer file results for S6 science run
